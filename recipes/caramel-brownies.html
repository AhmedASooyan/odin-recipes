        <h4>Makes: 16 (5cm) individual brownies or one 20cm round cake base (5 to 6.25cm tall)</h4>
        <h4>Time: 45 minutes</h4>
        <h4>Brownie Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>150 grams</strong> of unsalted butter, at room temperature.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>135 grams</strong> eggs (3 large.)</li>
            <li><strong>70 grams</strong> cocoa powder, plus more for the tin.</li>
            <li><strong>3 grams</strong> salt.</li>
            <li><strong>4 grams</strong> baking powder.</li>
            <li><strong>115 grams</strong> plain flour.</li>
            <li><strong>225 grams</strong>  chocolate chips.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <p>20cm square cake tin or 20cm round cake ring.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Recipe Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 175C fan-forced (195C conventional). 
                butter the bottom, sides and edges of a 20cm square or round cake ring. Pour in some cocoa powder and shake it around until the tin or ring is evenly coated, then tap out any excess cocoa powder. 
                Using cocoa powder instead of flour to dust your baking tin means there won't be any spots of white flour on the brownies when you remove them from the tin.</li>
            <li>Make the sugar mixture: Combine the butter and 100 grams of the sugar in a medium saucepan. 
                Heat over medium heat, stirring slowly, until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted completely, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the egg mixture: Whisk together the eggs and remaining 200 grams sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>Make the batter: Pour the sugar mixture into the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Add the cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and flour and whisk to combine. 
                An easy way to sift dry ingredients is to combine them in a bowl and use a whisk to break up any lumps before adding them to a batter. 
                Add the chocolate chips and fold them in with a spatula until evenly incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared tin until it reaches halfway up the sides. 
                If you are making a cake base, pour it into the cake ring set on a baking paper-lined baking sheet. 
                If you are making individual brownies, pour it into a square baking tin. Level the surface with a spatula if needed. </li>
            <li>Bake the brownie: Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Because of their dark colour, it's harder to tell when brownies are ready to come out of the oven. 
                Look for the top of the brownies to set, with a few cracks in the surface.</li>
            <li>Unmould the brownie: If you baked the brownie in a cake ring, let it cool completely in the ring on the baking sheet, then unmould it by pulling up the cake ring. 
                If you are making individual brownies, let them cool for 15 to 20 minutes until they are warm and set, then cut them into squares and serve. 
                I like to remove the corner square first to make the other squares easier to get out.</li>
            <li>While brownies are baking and cooling, make a batch of my go-to soft caramel.</li>
            <li>To ice, pour soft caramel over the pan of brownies; let cool completely before slicing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Makes: 675 grams, enough to fill two 20cm tarts or one three-layered 20cm cake, with leftover caramel</h4>
        <h4>Time: 45 minutes</h4>
        <h4>Caramel Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>320 grams</strong> whipping cream.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>200 grams</strong> light corn syrup</li>
            <li><strong>50 grams</strong> dark brown sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>100 grams</strong> white sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>4 grams</strong> fleur de sel.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <p>Digital thermometer.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Recipe Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the cream mixture: Whisk together the cream, corn syrup and brown sugar in-a small saucepan. 
            Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and cover to-keep warm.</li>
            <li>Make the dry caramel: Place another small saucepan over medium heat.
                When the pan is hot, sprinkle a thin, even layer of the white sugar over the bottom of the pan.
                As the sugar melts and caramelises, slowly whisk in the rest of the sugar, one handful at a time, making sure each handful of sugar has reached an amber brown colour before adding another handful.
                Once all the sugar has been added, cook until it has turned golden amber brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat immediately to keep it from-burning.
                (You can move the saucepan on and off the heat to control the temperature and make sure the sugar doesn't burn.)</li>
            <li>Combine the caramel and the cream mixture: While whisking, slowly pour one-third of the warm cream mixture into the caramel and whisk until incorporated.
                Be careful, as the caramel might bubble and spatter as you add the cream.
                Whisk in half the remaining cream mixture until incorporated, then whisk in the remainder.
                (A whisk works well here, but you can use a hand blender instead to give your caramel an even smoother consistency.)</li>
            <li>Clip a digital thermometer to the side of the pan.
                Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking continuously, until the caramel reaches 105C, 4 to 5 minutes.
                Remove from the heat. </li>
            <li>Finish the caramel: Whisk in the fleur de sel. Pour the caramel into a large heatproof bowl and let cool completely.
                Once cool, stir well to re-emulsify any fat that has separated.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Storage</h4>
        <p>The caramel can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
            Let the caramel sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes and stir with a spatula to soften it before using.</p>
