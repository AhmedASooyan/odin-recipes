    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <p>20cm round cake tin or 21x11 cm loaf tin.</p>
        <p>Stand mixer with whisk attachment or hand mixer</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Recipe Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 160C fan-forced (180C conventional). Butter the bottom, sides and edges of a 20cm cake tin or 21x11cm loaf tin.
                Pour in some flour and shake it around until the tin is evenly coated, then tap out any excess flour.
                If you're using a loaf tin, you can line the bottom and sides with baking paper instead of buttering and flouring it.
                (This makes clean-up a little easier.)</li>
            <li>Make the egg mixture: In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl using a hand mixer), combine the eggs and sugar and whip on high speed until smooth and lightened in colour, 2 to 3 minutes.
                Put the creme fraiche in a medium bowl, add a large scoop of the egg mixture, and whisk it into the creme fraiche to lighten it.
                Add the creme fraiche to the bowl with the remaining egg mixture and gently whisk until fully incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, lemon zest and salt in a separate medium bowl to break up any lumps.</li>
            <li>Make the batter: Fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture in thirds, folding until combined after each addition.</li>
            <li>Combine the butter and fresh lemon juice in a small heatproof bowl.
                Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each to prevent burning, until the butter has melted.
                While whisking, slowly pour the melted butter into the batter and whisk until combined.
                (If you prefer not to use a microwave, melt the butter in a small pan over low heat. Remove it from the heat as soon as the butter has melted â€“ you don't want the butter to brown.)</li>
            <li>If you're using a cake tin, pour the batter into the prepared tin until it reaches halfway up the sides; if you're using a loaf tin, fill it to about 1.5cm from the top.</li>
            <li>Bake the cake: Bake until the cake is golden brown, 55 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Unmould the cake: Let the cake cool in the tin for 15 minutes.
            While the cake is still warm, turn it out of the tin, then turn it right side up and let cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>My go-to nappage glaze.</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Makes: 500g, enough to glaze a 20cm cake, with leftover glaze</h4>
        <h4>Time: 15 minutes</h4>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>150 grams</strong> white sugar.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>345 grams</strong> water</li>
            <li><strong>15 grams</strong> 15g pectin NH*.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <p>Pastry brush.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Recipe Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the simple syrup: Combine about half the sugar and all the water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.
                Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Make the pectin mixture: Whisk together the remaining sugar and the pectin in a small bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Finish the nappage: Sprinkle the pectin mixture over the simple syrup and whisk until the sugar and pectin have dissolved.
                (Combining the pectin with some of the sugar before sprinkling it over the simple syrup prevents it from clumping.)</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Cook for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before using or storing. </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Storage</h4>
        <p>The nappage can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
            To use, microwave the nappage until it's hot and pourable, with a consistency similar to warm maple syrup.
            (add a little water to loosen it up if it's too thick), about 30 seconds.
            If the nappage has separated, blend it using a hand blender for a few seconds to combine, then tap the container on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles that may have formed during blending.</p>
